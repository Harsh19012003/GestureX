# GestureX 👋🖱️

GestureX is an innovative hand gesture recognition and virtual mouse system developed using computer vision techniques. It allows users to control the computer mouse cursor through intuitive hand gestures, eliminating the need for traditional mouse devices or touchpads.
By harnessing the power of computer vision and artificial intelligence, GestureX empowers users to control their devices effortlessly through intuitive hand gestures, eliminating the need for traditional mouse devices or touchpads.
GestureX opens up a realm of possibilities by recognizing and interpreting a wide range of hand gestures. Whether it's a simple swipe to scroll through documents, a pinch to zoom in on images, or a thumbs-up to activate a command, GestureX accurately detects and translates these gestures into meaningful actions. This intuitive and human-centric approach to interaction creates a more immersive and personalized computing experience.
Powered by a custom-built architecture developed using TensorFlow, GestureX delivers unparalleled accuracy and reliability. The system has been meticulously trained on an extensive dataset, ensuring precise recognition of a diverse set of hand gestures. With a validation accuracy exceeding 98%, GestureX consistently delivers the right commands, empowering users with a seamless and frustration-free experience.
